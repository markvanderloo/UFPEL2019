## Introduction

### The main question

Does international experience influence the academic output of researchers?


## Our researchers work really hard

```{r}
tab <- read.csv("../04Statistics/summary.csv")
knitr::kable(tab, col.names=c("Researchers","mean","standard deviation")
             ,caption="Output in articles")
```

## Output for each researcher


```{r, fig.align='center', out.height="6cm"}
knitr::include_graphics("../04Statistics/articles_by_researcher.png")
```

## Conclusion

- Interesting results
- More work is needed
